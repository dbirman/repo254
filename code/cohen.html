		<p class="block-text">In this experiment, you will see a rapid set of letters and numbers appear on the screen. Count each time a number appears (For example, if you see A, B, C, 1, 5, D, you would have counted "2" numbers so far). At the end of each trial you will be prompted to tell us how many numbers you counted. 

		Payment: You will be paid $0.60 for participating in this experiment. We expect the experiment to take no more than 10 minutes.
