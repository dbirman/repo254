		<p class="block-text">In this experiment, you will see a rapid set of letters and numbers appear on the screen. Count each time a number appears (For example, if you see A, B, C, 1, 5, D, you would have counted "2" numbers so far).

			At the end of each trial you will be prompted to respond, using your keyboard, how many numbers you counted during that trial. Simply press the corresponding key (0->4).
