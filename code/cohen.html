		<p class="block-text">In this experiment, you will see a very fast display of letters and numbers appear on the screen. Count each time a number appears (For example, if you see A, B, C, 1, 5, D, you would report having counted "2" numbers). At the end of each trial you will be prompted to tell us how many numbers you counted. Please read the instructions carefully on every trial--they may change throughout the experiment. This experiment is quite difficult, please don't get frustrated! Take each trial seriously and make your best effort to answer all of the questions.

		Please note: This experiment runs in full screen mode. If you exit full screen mode during the experiment your data will NOT be saved and the HIT will not be reported as completed! Please turn off background programs that might interfere with your browser BEFORE pressing start and do not exit full screen mode during the experiment. If your browser does not support full screen mode you MUST upgrade. You can check <a href='http://johndyer.name/lab/fullscreenapi/' target='_blank'>here</a> to see whether your browser supports full screen.

		You will be paid $0.30 for participating in this experiment. We expect the experiment to take no more than 5 minutes.

		You're finished - thanks for participating! Your data will automatically be submitted to Mechanical Turk...

		Please read: This experiment relies on the fact that participants do not know in advance that they will be asked about the scenes in the background. If you choose to review this HIT for others please do not relay this information! Unfortunately, you can't participate in this experiment more than once because of this. Thank you!!

		If you have questions, comments, or concerns, please contact dbirman@stanford.edu.

		We're really sorry but the stimulus in this HIT needs to be displayed on a larger screen. If you have an external display you can connect that, or run this HIT on a different computer. Thanks!
