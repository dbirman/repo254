		<p class="frontblock-text noprev">Thank you for your interest in our experiment!</p>
		<p class="frontblock-text noprev">You will see a very fast display of letters and numbers appear on the screen in front of a colored background. Count each time a number appears (For example, if you see A, B, C, 1, 5, D, you would report having counted "2" numbers). This experiment is quite difficult, please don't get frustrated! Read carefully, take each trial seriously, and make your best effort!
