		<p class="block-text">Thank you for your interest in our experiment!</p>
		<p class="block-text">You will see a very fast display of letters and numbers appear on the screen in front of a colored background. Count each time a number appears (For example, if you see A, B, C, 1, 5, D, you would report having counted "2" numbers). This experiment is quite difficult, please don't get frustrated! Read carefully, take each trial seriously, and make your best effort!
		</p> <p class="block-text">
		This experiment runs in full screen mode. If you exit full screen mode during the experiment you CANNOT START OVER!! Please turn off background programs that might interfere with your browser before starting. You can check <a href='http://johndyer.name/lab/fullscreenapi/' target='_blank'>here</a>, before accepting the HIT, to see whether your browser supports full screen.
		</p> <p class="block-text">
		You will be paid $0.40 for your time. We expect the experiment to take ~5 minutes.

		Pressing the start button constitutes your understanding of this HIT's full set of instructions. You can only press start once!
