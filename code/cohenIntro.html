		<p class="block-text">Thank you for your interest in our experiment!</p>
		<p class="block-text">In this experiment, you will see a very fast display of letters and numbers appear on the screen. Count each time a number appears (For example, if you see A, B, C, 1, 5, D, you would report having counted "2" numbers). At the end of each trial you will be prompted to tell us how many numbers you counted. Please read the instructions carefully on every trial--they may change throughout the experiment. This experiment is quite difficult, please don't get frustrated! Take each trial seriously and make your best effort to answer all of the questions.
