						Thanks for participating! This HIT does not require a completion code, everything was submitted automatically.
					</p> <p>
					This experiment relies on the fact that participants do not know in advance that they will be asked about the scenes in the background. If you choose to review this HIT for others please do not relay this information! Thank you!

				If you have questions, comments, or concerns, please contact dbirman@stanford.edu.

		We're really sorry but the stimulus in this HIT needs to be displayed on a larger screen. If you have an external display you can connect that, or run this HIT on a different computer. Thanks!
